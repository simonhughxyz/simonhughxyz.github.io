        <p>Linux has such a large following that many cities have regular meetings between linux and open source enthusiasts called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_user_group">lug</a> (Linux User Group) events, and Liverpool is no exception.</p>
<p>On every 1st Wednesday of every calender month a bunch of Linux enthusiasts meet at <a href="https://doesliverpool.com/">Liverpool DOES</a>, and have a general chat or even talks and presentations over Linux and open source related topics.</p>
<p>On this last Wednesday I paid the <a href="https://livlug.org.uk/">Liverpool lug</a> event a visit.</p>
<h1 id="about-liverpool-does">About Liverpool DOES<a href="#about-liverpool-does" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p><a href="https://doesliverpool.com/">Liverpool DOES</a> is a meeting space for hackers, builders, inventors and general cool guys and girls making all kinds of stuff, from the useful, to the awesome and even bizarre. If your head is full of cool ideas that just want to become reality, then this is the place to be.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at <a href="https://doesliverpool.com/">Liverpool DOES</a>, I was shown around the facilities by the host of the event, and they have all kinds of cool toys, from 3d printers to laser cutters. There is no shortage of things to work with or to make interesting stuff with.</p>
<p>But I was here for linux and the only tool I need is the keyboard.</p>
<h1 id="the-lug-event">The LUG Event<a href="#the-lug-event" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>The event was about half a dozen people talking about all kinds of topics related to linux and open source, and sometimes about other topics as well, such as cars or films.</p>
<p>I have been told that usually there would be talks and presentations on interesting topics, but this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_user_group">lug</a> event nothing was planned, nevertheless I had fun and found the evening interesting and the people friendly. If you have a passion for linux and open source, I would defiantly recommend going, and personally I will be going to the next one in May.</p>

<p>The Liverpool Linux User Group meets every 1st Wednesday of every calender month and anybody is welcome, it is completely free, and you will even get a cup of tea.</p>
<p>The meetings take place at <a href="https://doesliverpool.com/">Liverpool DOES</a>, at 68-76 Kempston Street, L3 8HL. Just ring the bell and someone will buzz you in.</p>
